# Work remotely at Mimo üöÄ

At Mimo, we believe that coding can open doors to careers and opportunities like few other skills. That's why we've rallied around the common goal of making coding universally accessible.

With the Mimo app, we've made it easy and fun for more than 15 million beginners to start coding on the go and build up their confidence to pursue a career in tech. From bite-size coding exercises to full-fledged projects, we‚Äôre helping our learners form a habit of coding and reach university-level learning outcomes. And with the launch of cohort-based programs, we‚Äôre well on our way toward becoming the world‚Äôs largest tech school. To help millions more learn to code and eventually become developers, we're looking for an Android Developer.

If you, too, want to make coding accessible to everybody, this is your opportunity to shape the future of tech education.
